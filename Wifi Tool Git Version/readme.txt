I built this project for a Funeral Live Streaming service that wanted a tool that 
could help their team of videographers keep track of Funeral homes they have 
worked with, funeral wifi names, passwords & strength rating of the wifi. My solution was to create a form wherein 
videographers can submit this information to a database via PHP & mySQL & then I made it so PHP spits out 
the information from the Database into an HTML table for everyone to see. Mobile responsiveness was of upmost 
importance as the videographers are always on the move.  
TOOLS: HTML CSS PHP MYSQL
